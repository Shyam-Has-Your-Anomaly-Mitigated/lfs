# Linux Fucking Sucks
*this time I will just do what the fucking [book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_From_Scratch) says*
1. lfs at all
1. lfs from [every host](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DistroWatch) (same architecture/tools/ETC should mean same lfs)
1. ~~checksum the results, and if they all match, the lfs is good; otherwise~~ diff the fucking hex dumps
1. make linux great again; build a fucking firewall, and make "them" fucking [pay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) for it
1. covfefe

need to study electrical engineering to formally verify open hardware

flashy "-things" are unsupported; but that's a good "-thing"...

# Perl6

I'm a [warrior](http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/perl-6-is-my-mmorpg), fleeing from the Cylon tyranny, on the last battlestar, Galactica, leading a ragtag fugitive fleet on a lonely quest: a shining planet known as Earth.
